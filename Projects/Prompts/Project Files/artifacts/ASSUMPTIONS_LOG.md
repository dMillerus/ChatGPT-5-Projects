## Assumptions Log

### Policy

- Record all assumptions made in prompt construction or updates.
    
- Each entry must include: date, author, context, assumption, and impact.
    
- If an assumption later proves invalid, mark status as **revoked** and update downstream docs.
    

### Template

```
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Context: <Prompt/Task/Update ID>
Assumption: <Explicit statement>
Impact: <What this enabled or constrained>
Status: active | revoked
```
